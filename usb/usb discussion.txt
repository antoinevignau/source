I can make USB host card using generic USB host chip and give access to it registers for example but all other work can be make with software , this is a many work for all kind of usb hardware , for example for Mass storage device (USB flash ) you can write support for SCSI commands and then convert it to GS compatible data format for rread write files ( file system) .

About USB I can make simple board with MAX3421E that will give to you paralel access to all registers of chip and interrupt .
This is common chip that arduino users use it before 10+ year to access storage and mouse and etc...
And on internet is have many examples and sources . but you needed to write ( rewrite ) full USB stack . This give you freedom to access all USB cases of device but it is many work .
Do you write in C ? or assembler only ?

This chip is give all freedom to make what you want ! It give to you aware layer for USB communication and small data buffer , all other is a your responsibility but USB stack I no so easy to write , also the interrupt is strongly needed .

About adress space , the registers of this chips is 32 :-)
 and needed to make some sub register access if needed to use only 16 addresses .
Of course can be provided ROM that can have watermark or all you want to be easy detect and handle the card .
But as say the USB stack is not be easy way on Asm. 
You can Google and see some example in C++ of the common USB stack for this chip (not the hardware access to registers )
It is possible to use CSXX address space for registers of USB chip .due to the chip has a 32 registers and using usb register access will be slowdown comunication ( usb register is one address select register and on another get/set data )
I can make simple protothype with minimal components to prove that all will work and after this can be extended or redesign for final project .

There are 32 8-bits registers:
R0..R20	max3420e peripheral registers
 R0..R4	internal FIFOS
 R5..R20	control magisters

R21..R31	max3421e host registers
 R21/2/3/4/7	in peripheral mode
 R21..R31	in host mode

About USB, I took time to read the documentation on analog.com
The MAX3421E chip is interesting (peripheral and host modes), a SPI interface, 32 8-bits registers. I also took time to read code for USB stack and host support (TinyUSB, MicroBridge). That sounds feasible and interesting to try. I am in for that project!

Let's begin with a simple interface (no watermark) to communicate with the chip. From my experience with Apple II cards, there are a couple of ways to communicate with a card, and we can select the one you are more at ease with. What I see from my readings:
- one $Cs8x to set the register index (R0..R21..R31)
- one $Cs8y to read or write data to the selected register
- one $Cs8z to get status bits
Standard approach (SSC) is:
- $Cs88 Data
- $Cs89 Status
- $Cs8A Command
- $Cs8B Control

The dark areas still:
- how to set/use interrupts
- how to use the chip buffer memories (EPx or FIFO memory)
(must read more)
