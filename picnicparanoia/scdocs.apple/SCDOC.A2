Box 280300Dallas, Texas 75228(214) 324-2050S-C Docu-Mentor:  ApplesoftThe S-C Docu-Mentor for Applesoft provides the most completedocumentation of Applesoft internals available anywhere.  You willfind the information educational, entertaining, and extremely helpful.The completely commented and ready-to-assemble source code is createdwith the aid of the Applesoft image in ROM (or on a RAM card).  Thesource creation process modifies existing data on two diskettes toproduce over two dozen linked sour&e files ready to assemble with theS-C Macro Assembler.The information contained on the comments and labels has been gleanedfrom many sources over the years since 1978.  (There has been nodirect involvment of Apple Computer, Inc., in this project.)  I havetried my best to provide meaningful, helpful comments and labelsthroughout.  Nevertheless, there may be some mis-interpretations.  Ifyou find any errors or have suggestions for improvements, please sendthem to me.Many of the label names are deliberately made the same as thosepublished in "Applesoft Internals", by John Crossley.  This articlefirst appeared in Volume 1, No. 1, of the Apple Orchard (magazine ofthe International Apple Corps).  It has been re-printed by variousclubs, including Call A.P.P.L.E. in their book "All About Applesoft".I have flagged about a half dozen bugs in the listing, and severalareas of very "improve-able" code.  These are marked with "<<<" and">>>" at each end of the comment lines.Apple II, Apple II plus, and Applesoft are registered trademarks ofApple Computer, Inc.---------------------------------------------------------------------Procedure for creating the documented source files:1. You will need an Apple II or Apple II Plus, with Applesoft eitherin ROM on the mother-board, in ROM on a firmware card, or in RAM on aRAM card.2. use any standard disk copier to copy the two original diskettes.Label the copies, and be sure to mark the labels "Drive 1" and "Drive2".  Store the originals, and proceed with the following steps usingyour copies.3. Insert either disk and type "RUN HELLO".  If Applesoft isavailable in ROM or RAM, the source-creation process will begin.  Youwill see the phrase "S-C DOCU-MENTOR: APPLESOFT" on the screen, andit will slowly be changed to inverse display.  You will hear variousspeaker noises, which are just there to let you know things areworking. When the process is finished, the disk CATALOG will bedisplayed.4. Insert the other disk and type "RUN HELLO".  Once again, you willsee the same displayand hear the same speaker noises.  Uponcompletion, the CATALOG will be displayed.Procedure for assembling the source files:1. You will need two disk drives.  The source file "S.ACF" assumesthese are D1 and D2 on the same controller, but you may change theseaccording to your configuration.  Of course,you will also need aprinter if you wish a permanent copy of the assembly listing.2. Load the S-C Macro Assembler, either regular or language cardversion.3. Insert disk # 1 in drive 1, and disk # 2 in drive 2.4. Load file "S.ACF" from drive 1.5. Make any adjustment to the title line you wish.  I have set it upfor printing 76 lines per page, because I set my printer to print 8lines per inch.  If you are using 6 lines per inch, change the titleline to ".TI 55,et cetera".6. Turn on your printer, and type "PR#slot" to start printing.  Youwill probably want to set "elite" or "condensed" printing mode,because some of the lines in the assembly listing will be more than80 columns long.  I set my printer to "elite" mode (12 chars/inch)and set a left margin of 10 spaces.7. Type the "ASM" command, and stand back!  The listing is 114 pageslong (including symbol table) when printed at 76 lines per page.---------------------------------------------------------------------
