How to build Moon Patrol
--------------------
By the original Author, Daniel Repich

1. Launch the AppleWin Emulator 1.29.16 or greater that supports SLOT 5 drives
   a. Make a PC batch file (launch.bat)
   b. echo on
      Applewin.exe -s5 diskii -s5d1 object.dsk -s5d2 shapes.dsk -d1 msource1.dsk -d2 msource2.dsk
      pause

2. Boot Lisa Assembler with modified symbol table expansion in DISK 1

3. From Lisa, load "moon"

4. Type 'asm'

5. Game will build and store object code on moon-patrol-object.dsk

6. Load "bug-fixed-moon-patrol-8-13-2021.dsk" game disk into DISK 1

7. Exec combine (this will grab the object code from the object disk and combine it into the full game disk)

8. Boot bug-fixed-moon-patrol-8-13-2021.dsk end enjoy!

Bug Fixes
----------
Demo mode never got to the end. There is a MOON PATROL banner that comes up when demo mode reaches the tank. We were in a hurry to release and this bug never got fixed. I finally fixed it.

Full base station is in this version. The CRACKED version doesn't have this.

If you want the memory map for the game to understand where things are at, I'll be glad to send it to you via email.
