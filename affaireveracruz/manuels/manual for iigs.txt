THE SYDNEY AFFAIR
Author: Gilles BLANCON
Published by Infogrames in 1986

You have just been appointed Chief Sergeant of the Saint-Étienne Research Brigade (Loire). As a non-commissioned officer in the Gendarmerie and a Criminal Investigation Officer, you are authorized to conduct any criminal investigation assigned to you.

As soon as you arrive in your new assignment, you will be required to investigate what the press will quickly dub the Vera Cruz Affair.

October 8, 1985: You are notified by the caretaker of the Forest residence of the discovery of the death of a resident.
According to this informant, it appears to be a suicide by firearm.
So you go to the scene with your team to make initial observations.
Once this is done, you will have to conduct the actual investigation using the resources at your disposal.


GAME PRINCIPLE

Did the resident of the FOREST Residence really commit suicide as the caretaker announced?

You lead the investigation and first make the usual observations at the scene of the incident.
A word of advice, however: be aware that an investigation cannot succeed without effective and complete observations. These serve as a basis for research and often as evidence. Take this into account...

1. Forest Residence: You are at the scene.
The "victim" is lying on the floor in the middle of the room. In addition to this gruesome scene, you notice a slight disorder in her belongings. First of all, you don't touch anything and take a few pictures.

Move the magnifier by moving the mouse.

Zoom in on a detail: Enlarge a detail by pressing the mouse button.

You can also search for clues in the apartment where the shot was fired by pressing the Enter key.

To move on to the second part of the investigation, press ENTER again.

Be careful, have you carefully observed all the details in the room? Above all, don't overlook any clues.

The second part loads automatically after pressing ENTER.

2. GENDARMERIE OFFICE: interviews and various examinations.

The Gendarmerie's experience in judicial matters led it to computerize very early on, outstripping all similar services in foreign countries in this area.

This is why, in addition to traditional methods such as comparing evidence collected, interviewing individuals, and various examinations, you can use the DIAMOND COMPUTER NETWORK.

The DIAMOND NETWORK offers you the opportunity to communicate with other gendarmerie services, prefectural administrations, prisons, and, of course, the National Police.

DIAMOND NETWORK ACCESS PROCEDURES:

Code M (message).
A message addressed to any department begins with the computer code of that department and its location. The body of the message must then include the nature of the information requested, as precisely as possible. The response from the department contacted will arrive in the form of a list shortly afterward.

Note: Remember to confirm all your messages by pressing the ENTER key.

Here are the exact departments you can contact:

OTHER GENDARMERIE BRIGADE

GIE computer code + name of the brigade.
If you wish to contact the ST-GALMIER Brigade (42), write GIE ST-GALMIER opposite DEST, then compose your message in the format INFORMATION CASE X. If this Gendarmerie Brigade is involved in this case, they will respond with the information they have.

There is one Gendarmerie brigade per city.

DEPARTMENTAL JUDICIAL INTELLIGENCE BRIGADE

Computer code: BDRJ.
There is one Gendarmerie Brigade per department, which, being fully computerized, informs you if a particular person is wanted. You can therefore send your requests to the BDRJ ST-ÉTIENNE using the following format:
IDENTIFICATION OF DUPONT LEON. If this person is wanted, you will know the reason for the search and by whom.

CENTER FOR JUDICIAL RELATIONSHIP AND RESEARCH

Computer code: CRRJ.
The Gendarmerie has a search coordination center. If you wish to obtain the details of a person known to the judicial authorities or to make a connection regarding a particular object discovered that may have a suspicious appearance and has been reported, you should contact this service via CRRJ LYON and compose your message as follows: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON OBJECT (maximum detail on this object) or ON SUCH PERSON (LAST and FIRST NAME).
If this person is known, you will have their photo and some information.

POLICE STATION

CIAT computer code.
Some police stations may have handled a case related to your investigation; it may be useful to contact them for additional information. You should therefore call them via CIAT MARSEILLE, for example. Then compose the message in the following format: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON CASE X.

PREFECTURE

PREF computer code.
To find out the owner of a vehicle whose registration number you know, you will need to send your request to PREF ST-ETIENNE (if it is a vehicle in the department 42) then mention in the message IDENTIFICATION 1111 AA 42 for example. If this registration number is of interest to the investigation, you will obtain the desired information.

PRIS

PRIS computer code.
If you would like to know information about an inmate, you will send your request to PRIS BEAUMETTES or PRIS ST-PAUL, for example, with a message like REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON INMATE DUPONT LEON. If this is relevant to the investigation, you will receive a response quickly.


Option D: STATEMENT.
To take a person's statement, you must first know their name and address (or where they can be found).

Option C: COMPARISON OF EVIDENCE.
You can compare a person's situation with certain elements collected during your investigation. But obviously, this comparison can only be made on the basis of a statement.

Option E: VARIOUS EXAMINATIONS.
As a Judicial Police Officer, you can order various examinations such as ballistics or an autopsy (SYDNEY AUTOPSY).

Option A: ARREST.
If you are certain of an antagonist's guilt, all that remains is to arrest them.

FINAL ADVICE: BEWARE of arbitrary arrests. Have you gathered all the evidence to provide indisputable proof?

APPLE IIGS VERSION

The MIDI music is titled "In Nomine" by Richard Allwood.
The sounds and graphics were adapted from the Amstrad CPC version.

The interface of The Vera Cruz Affair was less pleasant to use than that of The Sydney Affair, we took some liberties to make the game more pleasant to the eye. May the author forgive us.

The following keys are available:
• Open-Apple-M: Start/stop music
• Open-Apple-Q: Quit the game
• Open-Apple-R: Restart a game

Have fun,
