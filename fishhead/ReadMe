FishHead v1.0					  (c) 2011 by Brutal Deluxe___________________________________________________________________________Hello,	Antoine Vignau and Olivier Zardini, founders of Brutal Deluxe Software, are proud to introduce their newest software to the Apple IIgs community.	“FishHead, the Caped Copier” is Brutal Deluxe's answer to nowadays preservation matters on the Apple II. Its main features are:	- Recursive file copy		It recursively copies files from a volume to a different destination volume, keeping all original folders and files dates 	- Batch mode		It handles insertions and ejections of removable medias, thus allows you to copy thousands of disks	- Error management		During a copy, if an error occurs, FishHead tries to copy as much data as possible instead of skipping the entire file. For instance, if you have a 128KB file which has only 2 unreadable KB, FishHead will copy 126KB replacing the garbage contents depending on the kind of file (space character for text files, hex value 00 for all other files)	- Log file		All events are recorded onto a log file which has the same name of the volume you copy. That file can be handled with modern spreadsheets as it has comma separated values. The information it contains are: source volume name, destination pathname, GS/OS error code if any  	The source code of the program is not yet available.___________________________________________________________________________Installation Manual	1/ Double-click the "FishHead" program,	2/ There is no step 2.___________________________________________________________________________Minimum System Requirements	The program requires at least 128KB of free memory.	It has been tested on Apple IIgs ROM 01 & ROM 3 versions.	It is compatible with System 6.0.1 and above.___________________________________________________________________________Limited Warranty	Many of the designations used by manufacturers and sellers to distinguish their products are claimed as trademarks.
