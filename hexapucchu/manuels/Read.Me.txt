Hexapucchu, the Lost City of Patchucca August 2025____________________________________________________________________Some stories are just waiting to be written. Others should perhaps have remained in the shadows...Plot ______________________________________________________________I had only come to rest.Escape the newsrooms, the incessant calls, the back-to-back emergencies. The world could have gone on without me for a few days. And here I was, on a forgotten beach in Peru, the warm sand beneath my feet, rocked by the slow breath of the ocean.That's when everything changed.My gaze fell on a strange shard, an object with dull reflections, charged with a silence that the wind dared not disturb. I picked it up, without really knowing why. An impulse, perhaps. Or a distant, ancient voice, from another time.I didn't yet know that this fragment of an artifact would take me far. Very far.Into the depths of the jungle, into the heart of abandoned temples, on the edge of the vertigo of the unknown.Every engraved symbol, every displaced stone, every whisper of the past drew me closer to a forgotten truth. A city erased from maps, age-old traps, enigmas whose key always seemed to escape me in a breath.I was no longer on vacation.I was on a quest.A quest for meaning, for memory... and for something much older than history itself.Concept_____________________________________________________________Hexapucchu offers an interactive adventure with simple and accessible mechanics, inspired by the famous choose-your-own-adventure books.The game is based on a succession of screens, each representing a location that you will explore throughout your journey. On the left side, you will discover an illustration of the place you are in. On the right, a short description provides the context of the scene and important elements to observe or remember. Finally, at the bottom of the screen, several actions are suggested.It's up to you to make your choice by pressing the number key corresponding to the desired action.But be careful: each decision can influence the course of your adventure. Some will lead to discovery, others to a dead end... or worse.The game is full of little clues hidden in descriptions, images, or the choices themselves. These elements will allow you to better understand the hidden secrets and solve the puzzles that punctuate your progress.You still need to have a keen eye... and the audacity to explore the unexpected.Production: _____________________________________________________________Original Amstrad CPC version¥ TITAN (Eric Cubizolle): scenario, graphics, programming¥ Pulsophonic: musicApple IIgs version by Brutal Deluxe Software¥ Antoine Vignau¥ Olivier ZardiniThe game is available for download at¥ https://amstradmuseum.emu-france.info/¥ https://www.brutaldeluxe.fr/products/apple2gs/hexapucchu/Apple IIgs version___________________________________________________The sounds have been adapted from the Amstrad CPC version.
