i'm fEDDup v2.3				         (c) 2012-17 by Brutal Deluxe___________________________________________________________________________Hello,	Thanks to Daniel Kruszyna (krue.net) for his artwork, John Brooks for his 3.5" NIB code, Brian Wiser & 4am for their requests for improvements, and Plamen Vaysilov for his RamWorks clone card, visit a2heaven.com.	Antoine Vignau and Olivier Zardini, founders of Brutal Deluxe Software, are proud to introduce their newest software to the Apple IIgs community.	“i'm fEDD up” is Brutal Deluxe's second answer to nowadays preservation of 5.25" and 3.5" diskettes on the Apple II. Its main features are:	- Essential Data Duplicator compatible		If Utilico Microware's EDD or compatible card is installed in your system, it will use the card's powerful features to read track data. 	- Nibble and timing preservation		It saves raw nibbles and their associated time cycles in separate files, for both 5.25" and 3.5" disks.	- ProDOS compatible		That may sound weird but that is important. SST is no longer needed ;-) The requirement of two drives is no longer needed.  	The source code of the program is available.___________________________________________________________________________How to use?	- 1. Launch the application		Double-click the "imfEDDup.system" program	- 2. To NIB image a disk, press S (5.25") or R (3.5")		Enter an output filename of up to 11 characters		The copy process is launched...		If you have a 3MiB Apple IIe or IIgs, your disk will be read in one pass. That offers more chance to image track sync'ed diskettes.___________________________________________________________________________Main screen commands	- D/isk to file image		This option create a .DSK or .PO disk image from an unprotected 5.25" floppy disk. Enter an output filename of up to 11 characters. The application can guess the original file system. Launch the copy process...	- S/ave file		This option creates .NIB/.NIT and .EDD files from a protected or unprotected 5.25" floppy disk. Enter an output filename of up to 11 characters. Launch the copy process...	- R/ip 3.5" disk		This option creates .NIB/.NIT from a protected or unprotected 3.5" disk. It requires an Apple //gs, a boot from ProDOS8 (no GS/OS), 3MB of RAM, and a 3.5" disk in slot5, drive 1. Enter an output filename of up to 11 characters. Launch the copy process...	- O/ptions		Display the options menu...	- ?/Help		Shall I really tell what that does?	- CTRL-Q		Shall I really tell what that does?	- CTRL-X		Enter the monitor... Type 800G to re-enter.___________________________________________________________________________Option menu commands	- B/its		Change timebits of nibbles (1 or 2). Default is 2.		- C/hange original slot & drive		Select the slot & drive of your 5.25" disk controller card. Default is slot 6 and drive 1.	- E/DD slot		Select a slot where your EDD card is in (default is 0 and means no EDD card)	- (Guess) F/ormat of diskette		If set, the application tries to find the file system of the diskette and sets the interleaving accordingly. Default interleaving is the DOS 3.3 one.	- W/rite NIB files on disk		By default, nibble files (.NIB) are written to disk. If turned off and if you have an active EDD card to rip your disks, only the .EDD files are stored.	- N/IT files on disk		By default, timing bits files (.NIT) are written to disk. If turned off, only the .EDD or .NIB files are stored.	- O/verwrite		If set, existing files with the same name will be replaced	- P/refix		Display a destination folder menu, press:		- RET to push a prefix,		- TAB to change to next volume,		- ESC to pop a prefix,		- A to accept the current prefix,		- CTRL-D to delete an unlocked binary file.	- R/ead 3.5" again on error		Sometimes, a 3.5" disk is not read entirely in memory. To prevent creating bad files, the option loops until the disk is reliably read. You can interrupt by pressing the ESC key.	- S/tep		Select the arm step:		- 1.0 means every track (default)		- .50 means every half-track		- .25 means every quarter-track	- T/racks		Select the end track of the diskette:			- $22 like a standard diskette (default)			- $23 means one extra track		Now, you can copy up to 40 tracks!	- E/X/port as		By default, files are exported as EDD files. Press X to export a bitstream file as a FDI one.___________________________________________________________________________File formats	The application saves different files on your disk drive. Please make sure you launch it from a 32MiB partition to save several disk images. If the program encounters an I/O error while saving, that will stop the copy process.	- .EDD format		The most precise format. It contains data read from the 5.25" disk controller card before the Logic State Sequencer performs its magic. That means that data are read at a bit-level, it is a "simple" set of 1s and 0s.		Each phase contains $4000 (16384) bytes.		A standard $22 diskette (step 1 track) is 573,440 bytes long. 	- .FDI format		The FDI format is similar to the EDD one in terms of bitstream. It has a header of $208 bytes and each phase of $4000 bytes long is appended by $F8 zero bytes. That is the only difference here.	- .NIB format		It saves nibbles as if they were read by the Logic State Sequencer, therefore some protections may be lost (and I assure you they are)		Each phase contains $1A00 (6656) bytes.		A standard $22 diskette (step 1 track) is 232,960 bytes long.		For a 3.5" disk image, the length of the file is 1,376,256 bytes long.	- .NIT format		It saves nibbles time cycle in a dedicated file. The default value of the timebit is $2. The different values are:			- $00 for 32 cycles nibbles,			- $01 for 36 cycles nibbles,			- $02 for 40 cycles nibbles.		Each phase contains $1A00 (6656) bytes.		A standard $22 diskette (step 1 track) is 232,960 bytes long.	- .N35 format		It saves nibbles as if they were read by the Integrated Woz Machine on an Apple //gs.		For a 3.5" disk image, the length of the file is 1,376,256 bytes long. Please refer to John Brooks' documentation for more information.	- .T35 format		It saves nibbles time cycle in a dedicated file. For a 3.5" disk image, the length of the file is 1,376,256 bytes. Please refer to John Brooks' documentation for more information.	- .DSK, .PO formats		It saves standard 16-sec disks of DOS 3.3, ProDOS, Pascal and CP/M disks. The file extension is based on the operating system interleaving:			- .DSK for DOS 3.3 and unrecognized disks,			- .PO for ProDOS, Pascal and CP/M disks.___________________________________________________________________________File sizes for 5.25" images	The combination of the Track and Step factors generates files of different file sizes.
