The Secret of Anubis			       September 2025____________________________________________________________________Never trust what you see.Plot ______________________________________________________________February 1951.The cold had frozen Paris... and my business, when... a letter.It was waiting for me on the desk, lying there like the ultimate reminder that miracles still exist.Thick paper, the scent of aged leather, a golden seal pressed into wax: for once, it wasn’t a bill!The crest - I knew it. I had seen it once, often, then never again.TARIQ El-Nasir.Patron, billionaire, compulsive collector of lost civilizations. A man so mysterious I had never met him in the flesh. He was content to send me, by mail, the addresses of my future excavation sites. Missions that, so far, had never truly led to glory...Like that failed expedition to Sudan. I came back with two broken fingers, a heatstroke, and a newspaper article that didn’t even mention me.Since then, nothing. A silence as dry as a desert without an oasis.And now, he was writing to me again.I didn’t open the letter right away. I traced its edges the way you study a treasure map scribbled in haste.This kind of mail never appears by chance. And it almost never brings good news. More often, riddles. Traps. And sometimes... death.But in my case... I had nothing to lose.Concept_____________________________________________________________You play a slightly out-of-his-depth Egyptologist with a dusty reputation, suddenly summoned by an old patron for an extraordinary mission.This game is inspired by the famous Choose Your Own Adventure books.Each screen puts you in a situation: a place to explore, an object to examine, a choice to make.At the top-left, an illustration sets the scene.On the right, a description sheds light.At the bottom, numbered actions are presented.Simply press the number of the action you choose.Explore, search, deduce - or... die (it will happen... often).Some choices will move you forward in the adventure. Others will get you lost in the labyrinth of a puzzle or, worse, lead to your demise.Take your time, keep your eyes peeled, gather the clues and above all... never trust what you see.Production: _____________________________________________________________Original Amstrad CPC version• TITAN (Eric Cubizolle): scenario, graphics, programming• Pulsophonic: musicApple IIgs version by Brutal Deluxe Software• Antoine Vignau• Olivier ZardiniThe game is available for download at• https://amstradmuseum.emu-france.info/• https://www.brutaldeluxe.fr/products/apple2gs/anubis/Apple IIgs version___________________________________________________The sounds have been adapted from the Amstrad CPC version.
