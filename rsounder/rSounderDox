                        rSounder Version 3.1                               by                           Paul Benson & Brutal Deluxe Softwarev3.1 - 27/Feb/2024	1. When a sound is saved, its size is aligned to a page boundary. That makes it easier to handle.	2. The (c) string added as a suffix to all sounds is removed.Okay, well it's is finally done!  Of coures I'm expecting people to reportany bugs discovered.  First off, this program is still shareware and it isnow $7.  The reason for this is that many people said the original wasworth $5, and the second was worth more than $5 (not to mention inflation),and this version does even more.  If you are on GEnie, I acceptpayment to my GEnie account of P.BENSON1 via Gift of Time.  Also, myaddress has changed to:   Paul Benson   3300 Cobblestone Court   Raleigh, NC  27607If you paid for previous rSounders, you do _not_ owe any extra money.What's Changed?I've added some features to this version.  I'll just list them in no realorder.Support for opening WAV, AU, and MOD files has been added.  For AU samples,I only support linear and mu-law.  I could not find the valid code forA-law samples, so I don't think NeXT/SUN really supports it.  The othertypes I don't think are possible for the GS (DSP stuff).  I have analgorithm for A-law to 8-bit linear, so if anyone knows the AU code forA-law samples, I can easily add support.Support for saving as WAV and AU has been added.  This is what got memotivated to work on rSounder again as I had some nice GS sounds Iwanted to port to my PC.  The AU samples are saved as mu-law.Change Frequency.  This needed to be added to support WAVs since WAV filesonly handle a few set frequencies (unlike the GS).  Since I had to add it,I figured I may as well let users play around with it.  IT TAKES A LONGTIME due to floating point operations.  The effect of this is to changethe playback rate without changing how the sample sounds (i.e. no pitchchange).  The sound length will change accordingly.  For example, ifyour sound sample is 10000 bytes long and is set to play at a frequencyof 20000 (therefore a half second sound sample), you can convert it toplay at 10000 and the sample will be reduced to 5000 bytes (to maintainthe half second play length).  This is a pretty good algorithm and canalso be used to smooth a sound (by increasing the playback rate) orto reduce a sound's size with little loss to play quality.You can amplify the sound by railing it out or by a percentage.  The firstoption will 'rail out' the sound, i.e. at least one value will be 255 or 1.If a 255 or 1 already exists, then the sound is not changed.  The second optionallows the sound to be railed outside of the valid ranges.  There is aceiling of 255 and a floor of 1 to prevent improper sound data.  Thereis an added benefit to this in that the second option is by a percentage.So, you can actually 'muffle' the sound with values less than 100%.Easter Eggs!  If you can find them, you should be pleasantly surprised.Be warned, they do mess with the sound sample currently loaded.Yes, the opening sound was created with rSounder. ;)Please include this document with any copy of rSounder version 3 thatyou share.Special thanks to the people who already paid there shareware fee.  Whileit has yet to pay my rent, it is a nice perk.  A special kudos to the peopleoutside of the USA who took the time/effort/extra money to pay for theshareware fee.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised to get payments fromCanada, France, Germany, and other places.You can contact me at the above address, by GEnie as P.BENSON1, or the.net via baja@nando.net.Cheers,Pauley
