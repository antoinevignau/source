Shufflepuck Cafe					           Brutal Deluxe, Apr. 2014___________________________________________________________________________Dear All,Enjoy Shufflepuck Cafe, the unreleased game from Broderbund, on your ROM 3 Apple IIGS computer.This updated version now works the same way on both ROM 01 and ROM 3 machines!Segment $21 read the mouse coordinates directly from the screen holes in the text page, that does not work well on a ROM 3. It is better to use the tools ;-)Secondly, the behaviour of your opponent was calculated on values in bank $FE (the first ROM bank of a ROM 01 computer). These values are different between the two ROM versions. We have added the ROM 01 file in the SGS folder. This file is used to calculate your opponent's behaviour, instead of the ROM.Antoine Vignau & Olivier ZardiniBrutal Deluxe Softwarehttp://www.brutaldeluxe.fr/
