I traveled a lot in my youth, and it was under unfortunate circumstances that I met your grandmother...I was living peacefully near Santa Fe when, suddenly, my life was turned upside down. That day, I was playing poker with Walter MacDouglas, the son of the richest rancher in the area. I was about to win when the argument broke out: Walter accused me of cheating and held his gun at me... He was a trigger-happy jackal...Anyone could testify that he was the one who shot first, but the rule of the richest had long been established in the small town of Santa Fe.The only solution for me was to flee... I was going to try to make myself forgotten, perhaps in another country, perhaps with another people..."First UseThe game consists of twelve steps. You may need to skip to a specific step, especially if you're saving your game.Game PrincipleThe goal of the game is to escape bounty hunters and other dangers and rebuild your life in a quiet, forgotten place.The screen consists of a graphical section where you can see the scene unfold, as well as a text window, the lower part of which is used to make decisions.To do this, the player has the following commands:- Up and down cursor keys to display decisions,- Return key to confirm a decision.Be careful, you may sometimes need to react very quickly...Some commands can be entered using the keyboard. If a decision suggests: "I HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO DO," simply confirm the decision, then type the phrase: "I'LL MAKE THE HORSE DRINK," for example.Saving a SituationWhile the decisions are displayed, you can save a current situation. To do this, press the S key.Loading a situation or Resuming a game in progressAt the beginning of the game or if something unfortunate happens to you, you can reload your saved game. To do this, press the R key and then follow the on-screen instructions.Apple IIgs VersionTo fully enjoy the game's atmosphere, copy the Western.8 font to the System/Fonts/ directory on your startup disk.
